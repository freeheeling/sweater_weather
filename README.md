# Sweater Weather

## Project Description

Based on the premises of being a back-end developer working on a team that is building an application to plan road trips. This app is proposed to allow users to see the current weather as well as the forecasted weather at a destination.

The team works in a service-oriented architecture; the front-end communicates with the back-end through an API. My role was to expose the API that satisfies the front-end teamâ€™s requirements.

## Learning Goals

* Expose an API that aggregates data from multiple external APIs
* Expose an API that requires an authentication token
* Expose an API for CRUD functionality
* Determine completion criteria based on the needs of other developers
* Research, select, and consume an API based on my needs as a developer
